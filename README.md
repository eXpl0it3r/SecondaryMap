Secondary Map
=============

This is an extensions for the Free2Play MMOFPS (Mass Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter) [Firefall](http://www.firefallthegame.com/).
As the name suggests Secondary Map provides an additional map to the in-game one and is best used on a secondary monitor.
Firefall itself is using their in-house anti-cheat software called RedHanded, thus to not get in conflict with it, Secondary Map uses the very open Lua API of the game, which in turn requires the user not only to use the application, but also to install an addon for Firefall.
